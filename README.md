# [Outdated] Multi-purpose Discord bot

***

This is a bot I made using discod.js v12 which is now outdated and I have not yet gotten some time to update it, although I just might in the future with all the new cool features of v13.

## Features
* The bot has a mongo db database attached to allow it to have a server specific prefixes.
* It has features to display the total members on top of the server [Needs to be updated]
* It has basic moderation commands like clear chat, mute, kick and ban. If the server doesn't have a role by the name *Muted* the bot will autocreate one.
* The bot has commands to show the info of the bot, the server and any user.
* The bot also has music features which help it to play music using lavalink.
